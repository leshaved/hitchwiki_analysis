In general, I don't recommend to use the thumb on the Berliner Allee; to much traffic, few places to stop, nervous people, and you're still inside the town. Exactly in the spot I put there is a petrol station; it's on the other side of the street and people going to Poland usually wait to be there to refuel because it's cheaper, but anyway it's better than the thumb. So, few cars directed to Szczecin, but some of them anyway going out from Berlin in direction North (ask for Bernau too); once you're on the Autobahn (in petrol stations!) or also in the countryside it's easier to find somebody.", "datetime": "2011-07-15 02:36:15"}}, "waiting_stats": {"count": "0", "avg": null, "avg_textual": "Unknown"}, "rating_stats": {"rating_count": "1"}, "lon": "13.467210531052", "comments": [], "datetime": "2011-07-15 02:36:15", "link": "http://hitchwiki.org/maps/?place=8148", "user": {"id": "3564", "name": "Michelemormino"}, "lat": "52.560757957316", "comments_count": 0, "id": "8148", "location": {"country": {"iso": "DE", "name": "Germany"}, "continent": {"code": "EU", "name": "Europe"}, "locality": "St\u00e4dt.
