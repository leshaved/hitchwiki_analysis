# hitchwiki_analysis
Hitchhiking pick-up locations data from http://hitchwiki.org/maps/

Since hitchwiki.org is currently under renovation, the API isn't working properly. Therefore, I'm using old downloads: one for all points done in July 2015, and another one for 6 countries done in Feb 2016.
These countries are:
Germany ("DE")
France ("FR")
Netherlands ("NL")
Poland ("PL")
Great Britain ("FB")
USA ("US")

These files were used for data analysis in my article: https://opengeospatialdata.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40965-016-0012-1

Files are in *.json format.
